            <p>Minesweeper is a logic puzzle video game genre generally played on personal computers. The game features
                a grid of clickable tiles, with hidden "mines" (depicted as naval mines in the original game) scattered
                throughout the board. The objective is to clear the board without detonating any mines, with help from
                clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field.
            </p>
            <p>The game is frequently bundled with operating systems and desktop environments, including Minesweeper for
                IBM's OS/2, Microsoft Windows, KDE, GNOME and Palm OS.</p>
            <p>Business Insider called the game an "iconic part" of the Windows operating system.</p>

        <div class="content2">
            <p>The goal of Minesweeper is to uncover all the squares on a grid that do not contain mines without being
                "blown up" by clicking on a square with a mine underneath. In the game, mines (that resemble naval mines
                in the classic theme) are scattered throughout a board, which is divided into cells. Cells have three
                states: unopened, opened and flagged.
                An unopened cell is blank and clickable, while an opened cell is exposed. Flagged
                cells are those marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location.</p>
            <p>A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a mined cell, the game ends. Otherwise, the opened
                cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and adjacent to it, or a
                blank tile, and all adjacent non-mined cells will automatically be opened. Players can also
                flag a cell, visualised by a flag being put on the location, to denote that they believe a mine to be in
                that place.</p>
            <p>The remaining number of mines is displayed in the left corner, and the game timer is displayed in the
                right corner.</p>
            <p>The player uses information given from the opened cells to deduce further cells that are safe to open,
                iteratively gaining more information to solve the board. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine
                cells must be opened without opening a mine.</p>
